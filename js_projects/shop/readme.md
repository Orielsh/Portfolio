The backend use for this project is given by https://dummyjson.com/.
the cart is not a standard implementation, since it will be better to maintain the cart on the application backend server
and there is no option to edit cart on dummyjson, and also I wanted to practice some localstorage I choose to make it that way when I load all items in advance and store them in memory and simulate it as a real cart.
